# Architecture

mini-dsh is built as a series of layers, each depending only on the ones below
it. Nothing reaches upward: the kernel does not know about sessions or tools,
the harness does not know about HTTP, and the web host is just another plugin
composition that consumes the harness through the context.

## Layer 0 — the kernel (mini-Cordis)

The kernel is a self-contained, Cordis-shaped plugin runtime. It has no notion
of agents, LLMs, or tools; it only provides the mechanics of composition:

- **One typed event bus** (`EventBus`) with five dispatch modes — `emit`,
  `parallel`, `serial`, `bail`, `waterfall` — and per-plugin ownership: a
  listener registered through `ctx.on()` is removed automatically when its
  plugin unloads.
- **Fiber lifecycle** (`Fiber`): `pending → loading → active → unloading →
  disposed`, plus `failed`. Every registration a plugin makes is an *effect*
  with a disposer; teardown runs them in reverse order, awaited.
- **Flat service store** (`ServiceStore`): named capabilities published through
  `ctx.provide()`, read as `ctx.<name>` through a proxy, and consumed
  declaratively through `inject: string[]`.
- **Dependency-driven boot** (`Kernel`): boot order comes from `inject`, never
  from mount order. Missing dependencies leave a plugin `pending`; mounting a
  provider wakes it. Losing a required service disposes and re-mounts every
  dependent.
- **Composition loader** (`loader.ts`): a `cordis.yml`-style YAML file turns
  into a plugin tree through dynamic `import()`.

Everything else in the project is a plugin mounted on this kernel.

## Layer 1 — the harness

The harness composes the kernel's services into an agent runtime:

- **SessionsService** provides `ctx.sessions` — a registry of durable,
  append-only conversation logs.
- **LlmService** provides `ctx.llm` — a provider registry (`register`/`use`/
  `active`) plus a single streaming entry point (`ctx.llm.stream(request)`).
  Providers (`DeepSeekProvider`, `MockLlmProvider`) are the only model-aware
  code; the seam is the whole contract.
- **AgentsService** provides `ctx.agents` — creates `Agent` drivers bound to a
  session.
- **ToolsService** provides `ctx.tools` — a registry of model-facing tools and
  the guarded execution pipeline.
- **attachApproval** is not a service; it is a *listener* that attaches an
  allow/ask/deny policy to the `tools/pre-execute` waterfall.

The driver is the `Agent` class: it runs the turn/step flow over an inbox, and
writes every durable fact (user messages, assistant chunks, tool calls and
results, turn/step boundaries) to the session log. See [harness.md](harness.md)
for the exact flow.

## Layer 2 — capabilities

Capabilities are just tools registered into `ctx.tools`:

- **`fsTools(root)`** — `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep`, confined to a
  workspace root.
- **`bashTool(options)`** — one `/bin/bash -lc` command per call, with a timeout
  and process-group kill.

Because the root can be a *live accessor* (`() => string`), the web host can
re-scope the filesystem tools at runtime without re-registering them.

## Layer 3 — web host

`createWebServer()` boots a fresh kernel, mounts the harness services, registers
the provider and tools, attaches an approval policy whose `askUser` answerer
routes questions over SSE, and exposes everything over HTTP:

- **REST** for meta, model/folder switching, session listing/creation, message
  sending, and approval answering.
- **SSE** (`GET /api/sessions/:id/events`) streams a snapshot of the durable log
  and then live `session/event` frames — the client is stateless by design.
- The **React client** (`web/`) renders purely from that stream: transcript,
  tool cards, approval banners.

Routing approval questions to the *right* session uses the ambient
[`agentScope`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html) (`AsyncLocalStorage`),
which the `Agent.run()` driver populates while a turn is in flight — so
concurrent sessions share one policy listener without cross-talk.

## Cross-cutting: the event vocabulary

Typed events are declared through TypeScript declaration merging against the
package entry. Producers dispatch them, and consumers listen — both fully
typed:

```ts
declare module 'mini-dsh' {
  interface Events {
    'session/event'(session: Session, event: SessionEvent): void
  }
}
```

The event names are grouped by producer:

| Prefix | Producer | Dispatch mode |
|---|---|---|
| `session/event` | `Session.append` | `emit` (observer) |
| `llm/stream` | `LlmService.stream` | `waterfall` |
| `agent/pre-step` | `Agent.turn` | `waterfall` |
| `agent/request` | `Agent.step` | `waterfall` |
| `agent/turn-stopping` | `Agent.turn` | `serial` (observer) |
| `tools/pre-execute` | `ToolsService.execute` | `waterfall` |
| `tools/post-execute` | `ToolsService.execute` | `waterfall` |
| `web/approval` | web approval bridge | `emit` (observer) |

## The three invariants

1. **Model-visible means logged.** The agent never builds a request from memory
   or ad-hoc state — every step calls `session.deriveMessages()`. A test
   (`agent-loop.spec.ts`) asserts each request equals the log projection at that
   moment, even with tools in the loop.
2. **Chunks never re-enter model history.** `assistant/chunk` events stream to
   the UI for fidelity, but only the assembled `assistant/message` is a durable
   model-visible fact.
3. **A denied or failing tool is a result, not an exception.** The tool
   pipeline converts policy denials and thrown errors into a failed
   `ToolResult` the model sees; the loop never crashes on policy.

## Lifecycle in one picture

```
Kernel constructor
  └─ ctx (root fiber) mounts plugins: SessionsService, LlmService,
     ToolsService, AgentsService (services, so `inject` order is free)
  └─ tools registered as effects (unwind when their fiber unloads)
  └─ approval attached as a ctx.on('tools/pre-execute') listener
  └─ provider registered (ctx.llm.register) as an effect
      └─ agents.create(session) → Agent bound to a durable log
          └─ agent.send(msg); await agent.run()
              └─ turn() … step() … tool pipeline … turn/end
Kernel.stop()
  └─ detaches store observer, disposes every fiber (reverse effect order),
     then the root fiber
```
