# mini-dsh

A miniature TypeScript replica of the [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) architecture, built for learning: the same plugin-runtime ideas — everything is a plugin, typed events with five dispatch modes, reversible effects, dependency-driven lifecycle — reimplemented from scratch on a kernel small enough to read in an afternoon.

The reference architecture lives in the DeepSeek Harness repository (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/cordis-primer.md`, `docs/cordis-tutorial/`). This project rebuilds those ideas without importing them; the test suite reproduces the Cordis tutorial chapters against this kernel.

## Status

- **Phase 0–1 (done)** — mini-Cordis kernel: event bus with all five dispatch modes, fiber lifecycle with reverse-order effect disposal, service store with `inject` dependency tracking, and a YAML composition loader. 37 tests reproduce tutorial chapters 2–4 on this kernel.
- **Phase 2 (done)** — agent core: durable session log (event sourcing, `deriveMessages()`, fork), LLM streaming seam (`agent/request` + `llm/stream` waterfalls, mock + DeepSeek SSE providers), and the turn/step driver (inbox with `send`/`inject`, `agent/pre-step`, `agent/turn-stopping`). Headless CLI chats multi-turn.
- **Phase 3 (done)** — tool pipeline: `ToolsService` with the guarded `tools/pre-execute` → execute → `tools/post-execute` path, approval policy (allow/ask/deny riding pre-execute), and the canonical built-in tools `Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Glob`/`Grep`/`Bash` (legacy lowercase names normalize at the boundary). The loop spends another step while tools owe the model their results, with no turn deadline or step budget — the model decides when the turn ends, unless the user stops it. Verified end-to-end against the real DeepSeek API.
- **Phase 4 (done)** — web UI: `createWebServer` (REST + SSE) with the React client (`web/`, built by Vite). The client renders purely from the session event stream — snapshot replay plus live `session/event` frames — and approval questions ride the same stream, answered over `POST /api/approvals/:id`; routing to the right session goes through the ambient agent scope (`AsyncLocalStorage`), so concurrent sessions share one policy listener without cross-talk. A failed step closes its turn durably (`turn/end: failed`). The UI is product-grade: collapsible thinking panel, expandable tool cards, session rename/delete/search, a stop button (`turn/end: stopped`), syntax-highlighted code blocks, toasts, and a mobile drawer. 105 tests cover kernel, harness, capabilities, and the web API.
- **Phase 5 — G1 reliable harness (done)**: file-first durable storage (`events.jsonl` canonical + rebuildable `summary.json`), restart recovery (interrupted turns, unknown-outcome records, invalidated approvals), durable input queue with `clientRequestId` dedup, stop/cancellation propagation with truthful `cancelled` turns, provider-inactivity watchdogs, expiry-bound approvals recorded as durable events, and the six built-in tools with granted-root containment, observed-state conflict detection, and a real-Bash adapter (Git Bash on Windows, actionable disable when absent). Session data lives under `--data-dir` (default `~/.mini-dsh/data` for the web host). Tool containment is application-level — not an OS sandbox, and Bash is not path-confined.
- **Phase 6 — G2 workspaces & isolation (done)**: Work/Life-style environments with strict ownership at the service boundary — sessions are born into one workspace (routes under `/api/workspaces/:wid/...`; foreign ids are 404, never a leak), project binding (`project.json`) drives the file-tool grant so a session without a project has no filesystem access, overlapping/nested project roots are rejected across workspaces, and one app-local writer lease serializes write-capable executions per project folder. Permission remains workspace-scoped, while provider configuration and the default model/thinking selection are **global** (durable, shared by every workspace): each new session snapshots that global default and then resolves its controls independently at each model request. Session `provider: null, model: null` is an explicit non-sendable blank, while `thinkingLevel: null` selects the model default; only legacy sessions with no `session/model` event inherit the live global default. The web client gets a workspace switcher with activity/approval badges and project binding for new sessions. Isolation is application-level only — shell and trusted code run with host privileges, and this is stated in the UI/docs rather than claimed away.
- **Phase 7 — G3 modes, context, skills, memory (done)**: five bundled modes (Chat, Ask before changes, Edit automatically, Plan, Full access) plus workspace-owned custom Markdown modes; the third live control (mode) gates tool exposure as a hard ceiling at the next tool start and reassembles context at the next request, with pending approvals re-evaluated (newly unexposed calls cancel). One mode-driven context builder assembles every request with a truthful per-request manifest (mode/model revisions, source hashes, budget, omissions); budget = window − output reserve − margin with explicit trim order (skills → memory → oldest completed turns) and loud failure. `history: none/recent/compact`, manual compaction at completed boundaries into immutable checkpoints. Skills (on-demand `Skill` tool, hash-pinned, Turn-local) and memory (Markdown entries, five scoped tools, keyword search, conflict detection) live per workspace.
- **Phase 8 — G4 agents & compatibility (done)**: workspace-owned agent definitions (`agents/*.md`, bundled read-only Explorer/Worker, copy-to-customize, strict validation + hashes), one-level delegation through the SAME G1 loop and G3 builder (task packets, isolated child sessions, 3 active / 8 spawned per turn, unbounded child turns), child tool ceiling = mode exposure ∩ definition ∩ spawn grant enforced at every gate (no escalation via mode switches), internal spawn/list/wait/cancel lifecycle over HTTP, root Stop cancels descendants, durable spawn intent in child logs, Claude sub-agent import (supported subset + blocking-field reports, never executes imports) and a version-pinned Codex adapter that reports unsupported semantics.
- **Phase 9 — G5 MCP & hooks (done)**: workspace-owned strict `mcp.json` / `hooks.json`, AES-256-GCM `secrets.json` with masked management and rotation reconnect; MCP 2025-06-18 stdio (newline JSON-RPC subprocess) plus Streamable HTTP POST/SSE with session IDs and Bearer/OAuth access-token references; `mcp__server__tool` registration with workspace-isolated dynamic schemas, allowlist exposure, default-ask/wildcard policies, host `blockedTools`, Chat/Plan/Explorer/Worker ceilings, timeout/AbortSignal/cancel notification/process-tree cleanup, 3× retry, 5-failure circuit breaker and health reconnect, plus CPU/memory/lifetime watchdogs on stdio servers (application control, not OS controllers). Command hooks cover PreToolUse block/rewrite (final args re-bound before durable intent), PostToolUse flag, UserPromptSubmit inject, SessionStart/End audit and PreCompact gate, managed from the Settings → MCP/Hooks/Secrets panels. Audit events store hashed args/results, durations, identity — never raw secrets. Claude/Codex MCP imports record provenance, stay disabled, and never spawn. Browser-interactive OAuth authorization and pinned upstream compatibility fixtures remain explicit production follow-ups, not claimed complete; the plugin marketplace is G6.
- Phase 10 (planned) — dynamic plugins: patch layers, hot (un)load, provider swap restarting dependents.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm test         # vitest run
npm run typecheck
```

## Configuration

Both bins load a repo-root `.env` (gitignored) before reading
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; variables already in the process environment win over
file entries. Optional: `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` (defaults to the public API).
Never commit the key.

```sh
echo 'DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...' > .env
```

## Chat

```sh
npm run chat           # REPL; uses DeepSeek when the key is configured
npm run chat:mock      # REPL with the scripted mock provider
npx tsx src/bins/headless.ts --mock --message "hello"   # one-shot
```

## Web

```sh
npm run build:web      # build the React client into web-dist/
npm run web            # serve it at http://127.0.0.1:3082 (--mock, --yolo, --root, --port)
```

The toolbar switches the active model (`PUT /api/model`, offered names come
from the provider's `models` list; every step's request is stamped through
the `agent/request` waterfall) and the workspace folder (`PUT /api/folder`,
re-scoping the fs/bash tools through live root accessors without
re-registering them). The sidebar lists sessions with search, rename
(`PATCH /api/sessions/:id`) and delete (`DELETE /api/sessions/:id`), and the
composer turns into a Stop button while a turn runs
(`POST /api/sessions/:id/stop`, closing it with a durable
`turn/end: stopped`). Ctrl/Cmd+K starts a new session.

The browser client is stateless by design: it holds no model state of its
own — the transcript (including a collapsible thinking trace for reasoning
models and expandable tool cards) is projected from the durable session
events streamed over SSE, approval questions arrive on the same stream, and
answers go back over one POST.

## The kernel

```
src/kernel/
├── events.ts    EventBus: emit / parallel / serial / bail / waterfall
├── fiber.ts     Plugin lifecycle states + reverse-order effect disposal
├── store.ts     Flat service store; additions wake pending plugins
├── context.ts   Fiber-owned context proxy; ctx.<name> reads the store
├── service.ts   Base class claiming a service name on construction
├── registry.ts  Kernel: mounts plugins, tracks inject dependencies
└── loader.ts    cordis.yml → plugin tree through dynamic import()
```

### Concepts (mapped to DeepSeek Harness)

| mini-dsh | DeepSeek Harness / Cordis |
|---|---|
| `Kernel` | Cordis app + Loader assembly |
| `Context` proxy over `ServiceStore` | `Context` + `ReflectService` |
| `Fiber` (`pending → loading → active → unloading → disposed`, `failed`) | `Fiber` state machine |
| `ctx.effect(() => disposer)` | `ctx.effect()` — registrations are effects |
| `inject: string[]` + pending wake | service dependencies, not load order |
| `declare module 'mini-dsh'` merging on `Events`/`Context` | declaration merging on Cordis interfaces |
| `bootFromFile(kernel, 'cordis.yml')` | profile/bundle composition (simplified) |

### Dispatch modes

| Mode | Await | Order | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `emit` | no | registration | nothing |
| `parallel` | all together | concurrent | nothing (observer failures contained) |
| `serial` | in order | registration | first bail value stops the chain |
| `bail` | no | registration | synchronous first-bail |
| `waterfall` | chain | outermost→innermost | each listener wraps or vetoes via `next()` |

A waterfall listener that only observes must call `next()`; returning without it is a deliberate veto — the same standing rule as the upstream repository.

The turn flow, matching the upstream `Turn flow` map:

```
turn/start
  claim inbox (injected context waits for a user message to wake the driver)
  -> agent/pre-step (waterfall)      reject | enter(contents)
     reject, or a first enter rewritten empty -> close the turn with no step
     step/start
     append admitted input as user/message
     derive model history from the log (+ tool schemas)
     agent/request (waterfall) -> llm/stream (waterfall) -> assistant/chunk*
     assistant/message (+toolCalls)
     tool/call* -> tools/pre-execute -> execute -> tools/post-execute -> tool/result*
     step/end
     tools ran -> they owe the model their results -> next step
  -> agent/turn-stopping (serial)
turn/end
```

Three invariants carried over verbatim:

- **Model-visible means logged.** Every model request is `session.deriveMessages()` at that moment; a test asserts it with tools in the loop.
- **Raw `assistant/chunk` events preserve replay and UI fidelity** but never re-enter model history — only the assembled `assistant/message` projects.
- **A denied or failing tool is a result, not an exception.** The model sees the denial reason and the turn continues — policy never crashes the loop.

## English workbench UI

The web client now uses an English workbench shell. Switch workspaces in the app bar; filter registered projects and conversation history in navigation. Start **New conversation**, select a project or **Chat only**, and use **Manage projects** to open workspace project registration. Project registration and rename use scoped APIs. Removal refuses bound conversations with HTTP 409 and never deletes the folder or detaches conversations.

Model and mode controls live in the composer. The optional Context inspector is read-only and closed by default. Settings is full-height and retains Providers, Agents, MCP, Hooks and Secrets, with explicit global/workspace/current-conversation scope. User text, names, paths, IDs, tool output and imported content are never translated.

Workspace session listings may include optional `createdAt`/`updatedAt` from existing event-backed summaries. Empty conversations omit these fields; clients must not invent dates. No existing request or approval wire format changed.

See [design guidelines](docs/design-guidelines.md) for geometry, ownership and safety rules. Run `npm run test:browser` for fixture-backed Chromium interactions and screenshots. Visual signoff, native 200% zoom, screen-reader review and long-history performance acceptance remain pending; generated screenshots are not approved baselines.
