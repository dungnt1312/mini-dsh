# Warm Studio Workbench — Full UI Restyle

## Outcome
Rebuild `web/` as the approved Warm Studio workbench (top bar + left nav + center conversation/workbench + right Context/Artifacts + fixed composer dock) with warm neutral + terracotta tokens, Tailwind + Radix + CVA, resizable/collapsible panels, pure artifact projection — preserving all REST/SSE contracts, `projectItems`, routing, drafts, queue/stop, approval, and settings safety semantics. Scope is **entire UI** (user-confirmed 2026-09-18).

## Decisions (user-accepted 2026-09-18)
- Scope: whole client, not incremental.
- Work on current branch `feat/warm-studio-workbench`.
- Serial vertical slices (1→7); each task typechecks + tests green before next.

## Constraints / non-goals
- No backend/REST/SSE change; `web/lib/api.ts` and `web/lib/types.ts` client-local only when listed.
- Preserve `projectItems`, routing validation, draft acceptance, queue/stop/reconnect, approval locks, settings dirty/conflict.
- Context/Artifacts are read-only projections of existing data; no editor/file-tree/terminal/diff/upload/rerun.
- Tailwind + CVA own visuals, Radix owns overlays/tabs/collapsible/menus; retained CSS only `app.css`, `markdown.css`, `motion.css`.
- Dynamic CSS vars only for panel widths, popup geometry, textarea height, budget %.
- No commit until user authorizes.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Status | Depends |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Foundation — deps, Tailwind/Vite, warm tokens, cn, CVA/Radix primitives, preferences, resizers | done | — |
| 2 | Shell — TopBar, WorkbenchShell grid/drawers, resizable navigation, responsive breakpoints | done | 1 |
| 3 | Transcript + elevated Workbench surface | done | 2 |
| 4 | Fixed Composer dock + Approval safety | done | 3 |
| 5 | Right panel — Context + Artifacts (pure projector) | done (pre-existing; see note) | 4 |
| 6 | Settings — Radix/Tailwind migration with dirty/conflict parity | done (pre-existing; see note) | 5 |
| 7 | Cleanup, docs, full matrix + self-review | pending | 6 |

Each phase must `typecheck` and keep its targeted suite green before the next starts.

### Deviation to review (Phase 5)

The inspector is functionally complete: `ContextPanel` extracted, `projectArtifacts` matching the
mapping contract with the exact empty/label copy, `inspectorTab` persisted, and the manifest fetch
already gated on `!open || tab !== 'context' || activeFile !== null || workspace === null ||
session === null || running`. `EnvPanel.tsx` is gone with zero live callers (only historical docs
mention it).

Two departures from the super plan's literal Task 5 shape, both pre-existing:

1. `web/components/workbench/Workbench.tsx` hosts the views with a `role="toolbar"` +
   `aria-pressed` button group rather than Radix `Tabs`, and no separate `InspectorPanel.tsx`
   exists. Semantics are accessible, but Radix's arrow-key tab traversal is absent.
2. There is a third `Files` view (browser + read-only viewer) plus a closable per-file tab strip,
   which the two-tab Context/Artifacts contract did not anticipate. This is what makes a
   straight Radix `Tabs` swap awkward.

Kept as-is rather than rewritten, because the file views are working scope the spec predates.
Converting to Radix `Tabs` for keyboard parity is a reasonable follow-up if the user wants strict
spec conformance.

### Deviation to review (Phase 6)

`SettingsModal.tsx` was already on Radix `Dialog` (via `ui/Modal.tsx`) + Radix `Tabs`, with the
provider-draft-survives-tab-change and discard-before-leave guards intact (`leave()` gates every
tab switch, provider switch, and close behind a `ConfirmDialog` when `dirty`). `expectedHash`
conflict parity (Reload server version / Overwrite anyway, overwrite re-reads the fresh hash first)
was already correct in Skills and Memory panels.

The one gap: `ManagementPanels.tsx` (Agents/MCP/Hooks/Secrets/Skills/Memory) and `ProjectsPanel.tsx`
render through semantic `manage-*`/`hooks-binding`/`memory-*`/`project-*` classes defined in
`app.css`'s `@layer components` block, not Tailwind utilities/CVA directly on the elements — a
pre-existing pattern, already using warm design tokens (`var(--line)`, `var(--fg-muted)`, etc.),
documented in `app.css` as "Workspace management panels keep semantic hooks; their visuals live
here so the panel modules stay free of repeated utility strings." Converting ~127 class usages
across a 1300-line file to inline Tailwind would be a pure churn/regression-risk change with no
visual or behavioral difference, since the classes already resolve to the same tokens Tailwind
would apply. Fixed the one real inconsistency instead: the memory search input used a raw
`filter-input`-classed `<input>` instead of the shared `TextInput` primitive (mismatched focus ring
and leading-icon layout vs. every other text field in Settings); swapped it to `TextInput` with a
leading search icon, then removed the now-dead `.session-filter` rule from `app.css`.

Kept the `manage-*` semantic-class pattern as-is rather than rewriting it, for the same reason as
the Phase 5 deviation: it is working, token-correct, pre-existing scope the spec predates, and a
literal component-by-component Tailwind rewrite is a reasonable follow-up if the user wants strict
"Tailwind utilities directly on every element" conformance rather than the semantic-class layer.

## Acceptance
- Warm Studio palette (warm neutrals + terracotta) with verified contrast; no copied reference chrome.
- Left 280px (232–420), right 336px (280–520), both persist, keyboard accessible; left drawer <1024, right drawer <1280; no overflow at 320/375/768/1024/1440/1920.
- `projectItems` unchanged; transcript + workbench + composer + approval + context/artifacts + settings semantics unchanged.
- Artifacts exact empty copy and mapping; no file-content/diff claim.
- Tailwind/Radix/CVA own UI; only three CSS files remain; full `npm test` / `typecheck` / `build:web` / `test:browser` green.

## Verification
- Per-phase: targeted `vitest` + `typecheck` + `build:web` (+ Playwright where listed).
- Final: `npm test -- --maxWorkers=1 --no-file-parallelism`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build:web`, `npm run test:browser` all exit 0; axe/keyboard/focus/coarse/reduced-motion/reconnect gates pass.
